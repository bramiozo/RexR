# Must do's

* follow PEP8 
* write concise but descriptive code
* document architecture and functionality but code details it involves a user-facing API
* communicate/consultate on fundamental design decisions 
* communicate centrally on possible impediments/conflicts

# Should do's

* apply docstrings for distinct functional modules/functions: 
* apply unit tests before production
* document the computational aspects (time/space complexity), processor/memory bound
* use internal pre-compiled functions much as possible
* use vectorial operations as much as possible
* apply a JIT whenever possible.

# Must **not** do's 

* store private / personal information in the codes: none of the data we store in the repository should be traceable to individuals!
* hard code credentials: e.g. use environment variables or place holders!
