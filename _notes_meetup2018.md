 - max variance? --> better max variance between distro's for classes
 - lib: sparsebn
 - take number of observations into account for regularisation
 - patient x patient similarities and then dimension reduction?
 - interomic similarities between patients based on genomes (i.e. no start/stop/chr), how?
   d(x,y) within set is obvious, but how between datasets.

 - feature augmentation? 
 	- add transformations of the features
 	- add cluster-id from UMAP on raw data
 	- add cluster-id from graph clustering on similarity data.

  - select number of clusters based on significant predictive power for phenotypical classes.

  - parallel coordinates: inflate height on dim axes
