* relevance of CNV and mutations
* SNF/JNMF/Selective cross-correlation
* survival evolution differentiation: apply to all gene's
* unsupervised clustering on multi-modal distro's
* find best combination of Methylation/RNA for differentiating cancer types
* apply differentiation tests on survival/treatment effectivity 

* Repeat for melanoma
