    "* Selective polynomial expansion and iterative construction of sparse adjacency matrices between omics followed by sparse graph clustering (MCL, sparse affinity propagation, graph autoencoders). If we have 4 omics; omic1, omic2, omic3, omic4 we build super_omic1 = (1,2) and super_omic2=(3,4) and then we build super_super_omic = ((1,2),(3,4)), where in each step we prune on the fly and/or we prune a-priori by filtering out non-disciminative omic dimension using the standard statistical tests.\n",

    "* Apply graph-based predictive models to find important inter-omic pathways to differentiate cancer types: using graph convolutional networks, conditional random fields, Bayesian Networks..there is some intuitive relationship between the shortest path algorithm. More generally, finding pathways or a GRN is like finding the causal chain between some events and a result (e.g. one type of cancer, or the other of cancer) and AI is struggling doing exactly that, extracting causality.. In our case we have of about 30 billion pathways from the methylation and the RNA expression alone. So we would have to prune it beforehand by filtering out the non-discriminative dimensions per omic layer. Anyways, super vague, very experimental.\n",
